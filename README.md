OS: Windows


Folder 1 = Source / Torrent Download folder (Remains untouched)

Folder 2 = Destination (Should be empty, no requirement tho)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
e.g.

Folder 1 contains: La.Collectionneuse.1967.FRENCH.1080p.BluRay.x264-CherryCoke.mkv

Folder 2 empty.


results in


Folder 2: [La Collectionneuse (1967)] -> "La Collectionneuse (1967) BluRay-1080p.mkv"

For each Movie a new folder + linked file is created.

Note: Watch the cmd output "Skipped Files", if something is off check it out why. e.g. weird naming of source.
"Skipped Files" are all files which have been processed a second time and might have slight issues for whatever reason.
Look them up in the Destination folder if they are fine.
