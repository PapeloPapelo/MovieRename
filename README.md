OS: Windows


Folder 1 = Source / Torrent Download folder (Remains untouched)

Folder 2 = Destination (Should be empty, no requirement tho)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
e.g.

Folder 1 contains: La.Collectionneuse.1967.FRENCH.1080p.BluRay.x264-CherryCoke.mkv

Folder 2 empty.


results in


Folder 2: [La Collectionneuse (1967)] -> "La Collectionneuse (1967) BluRay-1080p.mkv"

For each Movie a new folder + linked file is created.

Note: "Skipped Files" are also files which already been named perfectly. They are hardlinked! It just means they been skipped by initial processing.
Just to be sure still check if file count is the same in source and destination folder by the end.
