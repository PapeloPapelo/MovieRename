OS: Windows </br>
Movies (not TV)

Folder 1 = Source / Torrent Download folder (Remains untouched)

Folder 2 = Destination (Should be empty, no requirement tho)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
e.g.

Folder 1 contains:</br>
La.Collectionneuse.1967.FRENCH.1080p.BluRay.x264-CherryCoke.mkv

Folder 2 empty.

RUN SCRIPT

Folder 2: </br>
Folder [La Collectionneuse (1967)] -> File "La Collectionneuse (1967) BluRay-1080p.mkv"

For each Movie a new folder + file link is created.

Note: "Skipped Files" are also files which already been named perfectly. They are hardlinked! It just means they been skipped by initial processing.
Just to be sure still check if file count is the same in source and destination folder by the end.
